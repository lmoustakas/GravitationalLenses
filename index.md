## Strong Gravitational lens systems in the universe ... are here

The project has these ingredients:

- Description of the structure of the synthesis list of systems
- Running library of publications on gravitational lens discoveries, catalogs, and properties
- Python code that accesses the online catalogs associated with each publication and adds it to the synthesis list
- Tools and resources that facilitate the web-based presentation of, and interaction with the synthesis list
